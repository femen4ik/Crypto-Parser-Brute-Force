Mrcrypto is a powerful and modular CLI toolkit designed for researchers, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to analyze and audit blockchain address activity. It allows users to scrape the most active wallet addresses from public blockchain explorers and test private key combinations against them using high-speed brute-force scripts.

The toolkit supports major networks including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Dash (DASH). With a queue-based system, concurrency management, and .bat launcher support, Striker offers flexibility for both single-chain and multi-chain operations.

Features
Address Parsers for:
BitInfoCharts: BTC, DOGE, LTC, DASH
Etherscan: ETH
SolScan: SOL
Brute-force engines for multiple blockchains

Mrcrypto repository is organized to ensure modularity and ease of use:

parsers/ ‚Äî Contains individual scrapers for top wallet addresses (one per chain).
tablet/ ‚Äî Includes brute-force scripts tailored for each blockchain.
run_parsers.js ‚Äî Script that executes all available parsers sequentially.
Mrcrypto.js ‚Äî Launches all brute-force modules in parallel (up to 6 simultaneously).
.bat files:
1. Run parsers for create bases.bat ‚Äî Launches all parsers and generates address lists.
2. Start.bat ‚Äî Starts all brute-force scripts using the generated address lists.
package.json ‚Äî Contains dependencies and project metadata.
This layout allows quick setup, testing, and extension to new chains with minimal adjustments.
